	Penn State Technical College(PSTC) is an upcoming learning institution that is intended to enhance skills of our youths.This idea came up in 2010 but it was put in place in 2015 whereby the school classes,laboratories,library,offices,hostels were well constructed and few students had already joined.The school runs it's activities at Nairobi town, whereby students are enhanced with technical skills to help them build their future life.It therefore offers a variety of programs which students choose according to their area of interest.
	The different programs are undertaken under different periods; shortest courses take two years. PSTC offers both Certificate and diploma courses at available fees. The institution has been growing rapidly as many students have joined and the facilities are well equipped.We always ensure the successful progress of our alumni, that once they leave school they have accessed several attachments and help them apply for jobs.Penn State Technical College has been ranked as the most improved college in Nairobi and thus doing quite well even in terms of technology.
